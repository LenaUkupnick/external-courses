               <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

            <div class="accordeon-text">
               <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

            <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
            <div class="accordeon-text">
              <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
                The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
